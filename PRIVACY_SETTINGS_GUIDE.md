# 🔒 Privacy Settings Guide

## Overview

SocialConnect now supports three levels of profile privacy that control who can see your posts:

1. **Public** - Everyone can see your posts
2. **Followers Only** - Only your followers can see your posts
3. **Private** - Only you can see your posts

## How It Works

### Public Accounts (Default)
- **Feed Visibility**: Posts appear in "All Posts" section for everyone
- **Profile Visibility**: Anyone can view your profile and posts
- **Direct Links**: Anyone can access direct links to your posts

### Followers Only Accounts
- **Feed Visibility**: Posts appear in "All Posts" section ONLY for:
  - Users who follow you
  - Yourself
- **Profile Visibility**: Only followers can see your posts on your profile
- **Direct Links**: Only followers can access direct links to your posts

### Private Accounts
- **Feed Visibility**: Posts DO NOT appear in "All Posts" section for anyone except you
- **Profile Visibility**: Only you can see your posts on your profile
- **Direct Links**: Only you can access direct links to your posts

## Setting Your Privacy

1. Go to **Profile** → **Edit Profile**
2. Find the **Profile Visibility** dropdown
3. Select your preferred privacy level:
   - Public
   - Followers Only
   - Private
4. Click **Save Changes**

## Privacy in Action

### Feed Page ("All Posts" Section)
- **Public posts**: Visible to everyone
- **Followers Only posts**: Visible only to followers
- **Private posts**: Not visible to anyone except the author

### Feed Page ("Following" Section)
- Shows posts from accounts you follow
- Respects privacy settings (won't show private posts)

### Profile Pages
When viewing someone's profile:
- Their profile information is always visible
- Their posts respect privacy settings
- If you can't see posts, it means:
  - They have a "Followers Only" account and you don't follow them
  - They have a "Private" account

### Direct Post Links
If you try to access a post via direct link (e.g., `/posts/123`):
- **Public posts**: Accessible to everyone
- **Followers Only posts**: Only accessible to followers
- **Private posts**: Only accessible to the author
- If you don't have access, you'll see "Post not found"

## Admin Access

Admins can see all posts regardless of privacy settings in the admin panel to moderate content.

## Important Notes

1. **Your own posts are always visible to you** regardless of your privacy setting
2. **Privacy changes apply to all your posts** - there's no per-post privacy control
3. **Profile information remains public** - only posts are affected by privacy settings
4. **Following someone doesn't automatically mean they follow you back** - privacy is one-way

## Privacy Best Practices

- **Public**: Best for content creators, businesses, or anyone wanting maximum reach
- **Followers Only**: Good balance between privacy and social connection
- **Private**: Maximum privacy, best for personal journals or testing
